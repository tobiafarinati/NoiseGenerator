      <!--<h1>What is the most powerful means of protest? Disorder, confusion, noise, the unexpected! And this is the basis of the music produced by the No Wave movement. This music was initially born as a form of protest in response to New Wave music increasingly influenced by the laws of the market and the big record producers, then it became a general symbol of protest against the spread of capitalism in late 1970s New York.
      Thus taking and amplifying the concept of musical decomposition this generator produces new music that can become the noise of your personal or collective protest.</h1>-->

      <!--<h1>What is the most powerful means of protest? Disorder, confusion, noise, the unexpected! And this is the basis of the music produced by the No Wave movement. This music first emerged as a form of protest in response to New Wave music that was increasingly influenced by the laws of the market and the big record producers, then became a general symbol of protest against the spread of capitalism in late 1970s New York. In the contemporary context, capitalism, which without realising it pushes us to continuously buy and induces new needs in us, manifests itself in the form of advertisements that constantly interrupt what we are reading, watching or listening to. The shredder is therefore proposed as an extreme metaphor for the concept of decomposition that the NoWave movement used as a protest.</h1-->

      <h1>The project aims on the one hand to investigate and make known the No Wave movement, and on the other hand to present a possible methodology of musical experimentation through the generation of sound fragments. The noise generator below is intended to stimulate curiosity about the movement by allowing you, first, to get to know the Dadaist musical approach used by the movement, and then, to deepen your knowledge through the archive of tracks to listen to. It is interesting to consider, in fact, that NoWave music at the time constituted an important piece in the history of punk music and musical experimentation, producing a unique and new sound compared to the parallel NewWave.</h1>
