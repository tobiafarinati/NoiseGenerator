    <h1>What is the most powerful means of protest? Disorder, confusion, noise, the unexpected! And this is the basis of the music produced by the No Wave movement. This music was initially born as a form of protest in response to New Wave music increasingly influenced by the laws of the market and the big record producers, then it became a general symbol of protest against the spread of capitalism in late 1970s New York.
      <br> Thus taking and amplifying the concept of musical decomposition this generator produces new music that can become the noise of your personal or collective protest.</h1>
